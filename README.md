Solutions were written solely in Python. To succesfully run scripts, pandas library must be set up. One script is dedicated to one task. For task one, script can be found at ```task1/map_reducer.py```; same goes for task two: ```task2/map_reducer.py```. These scripts aren't connected in any way and are self-contained. In the repository you can find initial data as well as files created by these two scripts.
